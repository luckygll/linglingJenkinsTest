
There was many fixes of false positives and serious problems like crashes, hangs, etc.

New checks:

 * Check for std::auto_ptr misuse (related to strict ownership)
 * Read array and then immediately check if the array index is within limits
 * assign pointer to int/long
 * assign bool to pointer
 * duplicate "break" statements in switch
 * matching "if" and "else if" conditions when using bitwise and
 * matching assigment and condition when using bitwise and
 * test if unsigned value is less than zero
